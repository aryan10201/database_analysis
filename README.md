## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend won't start:**
   - Ensure Python dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check if port 8080 is available
   - Verify Python version (3.8+)

2. **Frontend won't start:**
   - Ensure Node.js dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Check if port 3000 is available
   - Verify Node.js version (16+)

3. **API calls failing:**
   - Ensure backend is running on http://localhost:8080
   - Check browser console for CORS errors
   - Verify API endpoints in browser at http://localhost:8080/docs

4. **No data showing:**
   - Run the simulation first from the home page
   - Check if the backend generated data successfully
   - Verify the data directory exists and contains state.json

### Getting Help
- Check the API documentation at http://localhost:8080/docs
- Review browser console for JavaScript errors
- Check terminal output for Python/Node.js errors

## üéØ Next Steps

The system is designed to be extensible. Consider adding:
- **Real-time notifications** for new messages
- **Data export** functionality
- **Advanced analytics** and reporting
- **Integration** with real health data sources
- **Mobile app** version
